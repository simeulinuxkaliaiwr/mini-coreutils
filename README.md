# mini-coreutils

A lightweight reimplementation of classic **GNU coreutils**, built from scratch using **low-level syscalls** and **manual system interactions**.
This project aims to replicate essential tools like `ls`, `cat`, `mkdir`, `mktemp`, etc — one command at a time — without relying on high-level libc abstractions.

---

## 🚀 Goal
The objective is to understand **how `core` utilities work internally**, handling files, directories, memory and IO with **raw system calls**
